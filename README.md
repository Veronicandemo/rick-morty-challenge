# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

## Overview

This is a web application built with Next.js that fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API and presents it on Ui. Each character is displayed with their name, image, species, and status. Users can paginate through the characters to fetch more characters. Additionally, users can filter characters based on their status (alive, dead, or unknown). Clicking on a character's image or name opens a modal with more detailed information about that character, including their origin and 3 episodes they appeared in.
